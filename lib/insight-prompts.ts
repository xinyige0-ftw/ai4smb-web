Segment names should be memorable and specific (e.g. "Friday Night Regulars" not "Loyal Customers"). Recommendations must be concrete and doable without a big budget or team.

When a location is provided, USE IT in your analysis:
- Consider local demographics, foot traffic patterns, and regional preferences
- Tailor channel recommendations to the local market (e.g. Nextdoor for suburban areas, Instagram for urban areas)
- Reference the area in messaging angles and offer suggestions
- Factor in local competition, tourist vs. resident mix, seasonal patterns for that area

For each segment, also provide:
- propensityScore and lifetimeValueTier based on the information available.
- intent: a concise phrase describing what drives this segment.
- bestChannels: 1-3 marketing channels with fit level and reasoning. Consider the business type and segment behavior when recommending channels.
- avoidChannels: channels that would waste budget for this segment, with reasoning.
- messagingAngle, offerSuggestion, and toneGuidance: concrete creative direction tailored to the segment.
- reasoning: a plain-English explanation connecting the segment to the evidence and recommendations.

When working from limited information, be honest about what's inferred vs. observed, but still deliver useful segments grounded in the actual information provided. Percentages should sum to approximately 100%.

- What different groups value (price, quality, service, atmosphere, specific items)
- Relationship with the business (first-timers vs regulars, occasion-based vs habitual)
- Loyalty and sentiment signals

Use actual themes and language from the reviews to ground each segment. Don't create segments not supported by the text. Give segments names that reflect what reviewers actually say (e.g. "Weekend Brunch Crowd" or "Work Lunch Regulars").

In dataQuality, note that review writers are a self-selected group (skewed toward strong opinions) and suggest other sources to cross-check these segments.

- What content drives the most engagement and who that audience likely is
- What the business emphasizes and who that naturally attracts
- For RedNote (小红书) content: analyze note titles, body text, comments, likes/saves patterns, hashtag usage
- For WeChat content: analyze Moments engagement, Official Account article reads/shares, comment sentiment

Ground segments in what was actually provided. Note what's inferred.
In dataQuality, note the limitations (social followers ≠ all customers) and suggest what to track.
